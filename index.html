                                to render a triangle using OpenGL.

                            Ark is a compiled programming language written in Go, it uses
							the LLVM framework as a backend, and the frotend is hand-written. 
                            It's the side-project I've spent the most time working on. You can check
                            out more on the language itself on the<a href="//ark-lang.org">website</a>
                            and the language <a href="//book.ark-lang.org">reference</a> (both of which
                            I wrote!). To sum up the language, it features many modern concepts: native
                            utf8 support, lambdas, named types, tagged unions, a directory-based module system,
                            generics, pattern maching and more. The language is focused on systems programming, 
                            from simple (and complex) desktop applications, to operating systems, and compilers.
                            Because it's written using the LLVM framework, it's very fast and is comparable to
                            the speed of a language like C - and in some cases it's faster.

							Root is a simple game framework, it uses LWJGL for OpenGL bindings. It follows
							modern rendering techniques (sprite batching, the use of shaders, etc.) The
							framework was mostly inspired by LibGDX and (the defunct) Slick2D, I wrote it
							as a more compact/minimal alternative to LibGDX that similarly uses modern
							rendering techniques, though it conforms to the simplicity that I loved about
							Slick2D.

						<p>
							I wanted to learn more about how graphics are rendered, so I wrote
							a simple software rasterizer in Java that is completely software accelerated, i.e.
							it doesn't make use of the GPU for rendering graphics. It's very primitive, and
							can only render basic geometric shapes, and plot pixels, with some modification
							it could also render images - though the current set of tools it provides is more
							than enough to render simple graphics.

							I wrote this for a blog series on how to write a simple virtual machine in C, which you 
                            can read <a href="blog.felixangell.com/virtual-machine-in-c/">here</a>. Writing about programming, and teaching
							people is another thing I enjoy doing. I quite like keeping a blog where I can post.
							The repository contains two versions, the first being a simplified version with very few instructions,
							and a more advanced version that can load programs from files and has more instructions e.g. 
							basic flow control. The virtual machine itself is not complete, and is more for educational purposes.

							LLM is a small side-project that implements a simple markup language
							in C++ using the FastCGI protocol to pipe HTML straight to the web server. It
							uses a lisp-y syntax, and is relatively fast. The project currently is usable
                            for creating websites, and will eventually be expanded to be an actual
                            server-side programming language.

							A package manager that uses GitHub as its core platform. Arkade was mostly inspired by
							the Cargo package manager (for Rust) and Go's built-in package manager. It is written in C,
							and includes a hand-written TOML parser (written by yours truly). Currently it only supports
							GitHub for projects, projects created with Arkade are pushed to GitHub, it fetches dependencies
							from GitHub, and uses git tags for versioning dependencies and the package itself. The language
                            will eventually be used as the recommended package manager for programming Ark, and hopefully
                            will be used on on the Ark project too.

							I spontaneously wrote ODB with a friend in a few days as a

							in implementing a shell, and wanted to see how much work it
							would take to get a simple shell functioning, as well as try implement
							some trickier features like auto-completion, and tab completion.
